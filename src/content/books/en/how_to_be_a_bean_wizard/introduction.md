# Как стать мастером бобов

> If you are reading this, you have been tricked by the promise of magic and
> fantasy (blame the person who selected the book title). Instead, your gruesome
> journey towards becoming a true game developer has started.

> Within these pages you will discover the reasons why you should have paid
> attention during you math classes instead of doodling or falling asleep. The
> blame for this inattention can of course be partially placed on your math
> teacher, who possibly didn't understand math good enough to come to the
> conclusion that math is everything and everything is math. Games are math, and
> without having a good enough grip on it to tame it, you will only be able to
> create a game which "kind of works", lacking the performance and grace of a
> true polished work of art. But fear not, math is not difficult once truly
> understood. Like language, it doesn't need (much) memorization, since
> everything follows naturally from simple concepts. All math mentioned here has
> practical uses in game development and is illustrated using examples from
> possible games. Now, you should get started. You can begin with any topic you
> like, as it is all connected, there is no beginning as there is no end.
